# Staking Alternatives Comparison

## Overview of Staking Alternatives as an Investment

During the Keep Network StakeDrop, the subsidies make it a very strong investment. At Full Production with no Subsidies returns will depend on several elements, mainly Transaction Volume, Fees and Collateral Requirement Changes (if any).

There is no simple, straightforward answer to the Opportunity Cost question, i.e. how does staking in Keep Network compare to alternatives. The following benchmarking analysis of somewhat similar Node Operation options can guide the financial investment decision, on top of the obvious highlight that staking in Keep Network will support the most descentralized, censorship resistant Bridge across Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The Risk / Reward ratio can vary a lot for these options, and the availability to participate for individual investors/node operators varies a lot too. Several alternatives are not available directly for individual investors, only indirectly by **delegating** or **nominating** to a pool (**Validators**). Examples of Validators are [Bison Trails](https://bisontrails.co/) who support the Keep Network and have been participating in early activities to bootstrap the Network.

There are two main alternatives to invest in operating Nodes for Staking purposes:
* Stake to support a specific application (e.g. tBTC, RenBTC, ThorChain)
* Stake to support operation of a Blockchain (e.g. Cosmos, PolkaDot, Kusama, Zilliqa, ETH2, etc.)


## Comparison with similar Service (Asset Transfer across Chains)

| **Application**| **Technology**|**Staking Requirements**|**Token**|**ROI Expectations**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| tBTC | Random Beacon, ECDSA| Random Beacon: 90,000 KEEP, ECDSA: 150%+ of the Minted BTC| Random Beacon: [KEEP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/keep-network), ECDSA: ETH initially, Later KEEP | See above for Key ROI considerations. Very Strong incentives during Stakedrop to participate and bootstrap the Network | 
|Ren|  Dark Node | 10,000 Nodes Max, 100,000 REN per Node| [REN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ren)| For August 2020 Cycle, there were ~$146,000 in Rewards for 1195 Nodes, i.e. $122/Node, 3.6%/year (assuming same rewards, ~$40,000 staked for a Node). With increased volume of transfers, rewards will go up. Check [Current Cycle Rewards](https://mainnet.renproject.io/darknodes). Several considerations for rewards accrual make calculations complicated: [Epochs, Registration, Deregistration](https://docs.renproject.io/darknodes/community/darknode-epoch-cycle-changes#darknode-epoch-cycle-or-renvm-mainnet) | 
|ThorChain (still in Beta, Binance Chain application)|  THORNode | 99 Nodes Max, 1 Million+ RUNE per Node| [RUNE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/thorchain)| Initial Investment is very high ($500K+), not well suited for individual investors, can participate through pools. ~32.97% for Delegator, adjusted reward after inlation is 5.54%.

## Comparison with other Staking Investment Options

Staking in another Network can produce rewards that range around 3%-10% (after inflation of those tokens). There are many factors that affect that calculation. Staking in Keep Network as an active strategy will outperform all of them at least during the Stakedrop Phase.

Note that all Network Staking Options show % Rewards in Nominal terms, i.e. if you stake in DOT tokens, rewards are in DOT tokens, therefore it is almost impossible to anticipate returns in Fiat currency. Also, these networks have Inflation enabled to pay for these rewards, so both your stake and rewards are diluted. That effect is not shown below, but it is calculated in the [Staking Rewards Site](https://www.stakingrewards.com/) used for  reference.
